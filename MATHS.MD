## Some Basic Rules

Two minuses make a plus so: - (-32) = 32:

= -2*(3) - 4*(-8)
= -6 - (-32)
= - 6 + 32 = 26

When simplifying a multiplication:

n(n+1)

= (n * n) + (n * 1)
= n² + n

## Square Root

A square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number.

Example: 4 × 4 = 16, so a square root of 16 is 4.

Note that (−4) × (−4) = 16 too, so −4 is also a square root of 16.

## Multiply Out and Combine Like Terms

"Like terms" are terms whose variables (and their exponents such as the 2 in x2) are the same. In other words, terms that are "like" each other.

Note: the coefficients (the numbers you multiply by, such as "5" in 5x) can be different.

T(n) = c2 * n(n+1) + c3 * n2 + c1 * (n+1) + c4 = an2 + bn + c

c2 * (n * n + n * 1) + c3 * c1 * (n + 1) + c4

(c2 * n²) + (c2 * n) + c3 * (c1 * n) + (c1 * 1) + c4

(c2 + c3) * n² * (c2 + c1) * n + (c1 + c4)

a * n² + b * n + c

a = (c2 + c3)
b = (c2 + c1)
c = (c1 + c4)
