## Some Basic Rules

### How signs affect multiplication

| Left Sign | Right Sign | Output |
|-----------|------------|--------|
|     +     |     +      |    +   |
|     +     |     -      |    -   |
|     -     |     +      |    -   |
|     -     |     -      |    +   |


### Two minuses make a plus 

So: - (-32) = 32:

= -2*(3) - 4*(-8)
= -6 - (-32)
= - 6 + 32 = 26

### Simplifying Equations

When simplifying a multiplication, multiply out, remove parentheses and then combine like terms:

n(n+1)

= (n * n) + (n * 1) = n² + n

When simplifying equations **IF** there is no coefficient before a set of brackets it always be a multiplication of 1, and this can be confusing,
taking the following simplification:

(5y - 6) - (4 - 7y) = 5y - 6 - 4 **+ 7y**

It might not appear obvious at first where the +7 comes from, but remember multiply two negative numbers and you will get a positive number:

(5y - 6) - (-1 * 4) + (-1 * -7) = 5y - 6 - 4 **+ 7y**

## Absolute Value ##

The absolute value of a real number *x* is the non negative value of *x* without regard to its sign. What this means is the distance of *x* from 0 in either direction,
so the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of -3 is also 3 (the distance of -3 and 3 from 0 are both 3).

## Square Root

A square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number.

Example: 4 × 4 = 16, so a square root of 16 is 4.

Note that (−4) × (−4) = 16 too, so −4 is also a square root of 16.

## Algebraic Formulas

## Polynomial Function

A polynomial function is a function such as a quadratic, a cubic, a quartic, and so on, involving only non-negative integer powers of *x*. 

We can give a general definition of a polynomial, and define its degree. For example:

This function is a polynomial of degree 3, as 3 is the highest power of *x* in the formula. This is called a cubic
polynomial, or just a cubic.

f(x) = 4x³ − 3x² + 2

This is a polynomial of degree 2, as 2 is the highest power of x. This is called a quadratic.

f(x) = 4x² − 2x − 4


## Constant Function

f(x) = 2 is a constant function.

## Linear Function

 f(x) = 2x + 1 is a linear function.

## Quadratic Equation

The generalised quadratic equation is of the form: y = ax2 + bx + c

This is because quadratic is a special name we use in maths for order two polynomials. A polynomial is any function which contains multiple powers of the independent variable (x) with appropriate coefficients. The order of the polynomial is equal to its highest power of x.

A simple example is as follows:

f(x) = 4x² − 2x − 4 is a quadratic function.

## Multiply Out and Combine Like Terms

"Like terms" are terms whose variables (and their exponents such as the 2 in x2) are the same. In other words, terms that are "like" each other.

Note: the coefficients (the numbers you multiply by, such as "5" in 5x) can be different.

T(n) = c2 * n(n+1) + c3 * n2 + c1 * (n+1) + c4 = an2 + bn + c

c2 * (n * n + n * 1) + c3 * c1 * (n + 1) + c4

(c2 * n²) + (c2 * n) + c3 * (c1 * n) + (c1 * 1) + c4

(c2 + c3) * n² * (c2 + c1) * n + (c1 + c4)

a * n² + b * n + c

a = (c2 + c3)
b = (c2 + c1)
c = (c1 + c4)
