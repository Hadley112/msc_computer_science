# Queue Data Structure

The queue data structure is also a type of dynamic set, like stack. A queue operates much in the same way as a queue at a super market where a **first in first out (fifo)** policy is in place, this in contrast to a stack where a **last in first out (lifo)** policy is in place.

The insert operation on a queue is called **ENQUEUE**, and the delete operation on a queue is called **DEQUEUE**, like the **POP** operation on a stack, **DEQUEUE** does not take an element to remove, but instead removes the element indicated to be at the *head* of the queue.

A queue has a **head** and a **tail** and when an element is enqueued it takes its place at the tail of the queue, it is last in line to be processed, like a new customer arriving to join a queue at the supermarket. The element that is dequeued is always the element at the **head** of the queue.
